### Notes for Course: "Learn How to Learn"

#### **Week 1**

- **Two Activity Modes**: The brain operates in two modes—focused and diffuse. To maximize learning, alternate between intense focus and relaxation.
- **Take Action**: Don’t overthink—just start. Emphasize regularity, moderation, and sustained focus in your learning habits.
- **Effort + Sleep = Long-term Memory**: To store information in long-term memory and apply it effectively later, put in consistent effort. Prioritize getting 8 hours of quality sleep each night.

#### **Week 4**

- **The Law of 33%**: 
	- Spend time with three types of groups:
		1. Those better than you (to learn and be inspired).
		2. Those at the same level as you (to collaborate and practice).
		3. Those less experienced than you (to teach and solidify your understanding).
