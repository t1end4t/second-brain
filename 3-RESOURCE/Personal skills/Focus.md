- **Each week, conduct a "weekly review"**. Write down what happened during the week. Check whether you're getting closer to your true goals. What tasks consumed your time and energy without yielding meaningful results? Are you closer to your life's goals compared to the previous week? Then, set goals and intentions for the upcoming week. 
- **Be ruthless in eliminating things that don't bring you closer to your goals**. Focus is the art of saying no to most things. Before doing anything during the day, take a few seconds to honestly assess: Does this activity help you get closer to a specific goal? If not, consider it a random action with no real purposeâ€”and eliminate it. 
- **Spend a few minutes each morning deciding on one thing you must focus on for the day**. One of the hardest tasks each morning is narrowing your daily goals to just one. This requires you to take full responsibility for this goal. You can't use the excuse, "I had to focus on other tasks," to justify not completing it. You'll find that this practice greatly enhances your focus for the day. Tackling priorities helps you accomplish more and reduces stress by preventing goal overload.
